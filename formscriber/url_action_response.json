If you do not, please check the link and that your form is shared with anyone who has that link. Not to worry, Form Scriber does not store any information nor does it make copies of your report. Feel free to view out privacy conditions and terms of service on formscriber.com. To start filling your form, begin by saying: 'Form name, followed by the value you want to be filled in your report'. For example, if you have a field called 'title' and want to give it a value called 'Hello World' you would say: 'Title, Hello World'. You cannot update the same field once it has been updated because we lose the placeholder once it is overwritten. Which field would you like to do first?"
